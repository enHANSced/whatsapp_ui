# WhatsApp UI Clone - Because Why Not?

Welcome to my WhatsApp UI clone project! 📱🚀

## Why?

Why not? It's like trying to clone the Mona Lisa, but with a lot more emojis and less artistic talent. 😅

## What?

This project is a Flutter application that aims to replicate the android user interface of the popular messaging app WhatsApp. It's like a time machine that takes you back to the early 2020s, but with a modern twist. 🕰️

## How?

We're using Flutter, the magic potion of the modern app development world. It's like having a magic wand that can create apps for Android, iOS, web, and desktop from a single codebase. 🧙‍♂️

## Features (UI only)

- **Chats**: Because who doesn't love chatting? 💬
- **Status**: Share your mood with the world. Or just pretend you're happy. 😎
- **Calls**: Because sometimes, you just need to talk to someone. 📞
- **Camera**: Because who doesn't love taking selfies? 📸
